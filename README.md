# stock-analysis
Module 2 Challenge of bootcamp

## Overview of Project
An original script for VBA analysis of Green Energy stock was created to analyze the performance of 12 different Green Energy stocks in the years 2017 and 2018. The goal of this project was to refactor the original script to make it gather the same information, only faster. This project was taken on to ensure that this code can run efficiently and accurately if used to run analysis of the entire stock market, versus the dozen stocks that the original code was written to analyze.

## Results
This analysis was performed to assess the performance of each stock based on its Yearly Volume, how often the stock gets traded, and its Yearly Return, the percentage increase (or decrease) in stock price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.

Below are screenshots of the VBA Analysis generated with the refactored code:

we can conclude
- Green Energy Stocks in general saw a significant decrease in performance in 2018 from 2017.
- The amount that a stock is traded, its Yearly Volume, does not necessarily influence it's Yearly Return.
- DQ's stock plummeted in 2018, going from having the highest Yearly Return in 2017 to the lowest Yearly Return in 2018.
- Based on 2017 and 2018 data, ENPH and RUN have continued to see positive returns accross the last two years.

### Comparison of Execution Times
We wanted to make a refactored code to be able to
optimize times and process

here are the results

## Summary
The advantages of doing a refactored in a code is that you can be more efficient with variables and you can optimize times when they are large projects, otherwise a disadvantage is having to review line by line and maybe you can get stuck and leave the code worse
